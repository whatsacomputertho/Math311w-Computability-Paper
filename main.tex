\section{Introduction}
In the age of digital communications, it is difficult to imagine how, in a world without digital computers, one might work toward the development of one.  As a result, often overlooked are the initial developments which led to today's digital age.  Nevertheless, the emergence of digital computers would not be possible without initial, groundbreaking developments in mathematical logic and information theory from significant engineers and mathematicians like Alan Turing and Claude Shannon.  Throughout this paper, we discuss computability in a rigorous, self-contained manner - both its proof by construction and its disproof by contradiction, with examples of each.  Furthermore, we aim to provide our readers with some historical insight into the development of these methods in order to build both an appreciation of their significance, and of the current challenges researchers face as attempts are made to further progress in theoretical computer science \cite{1}.

\section{Background}
Here we introduce the background section
\subsection{Historical Background}
Here we discuss the history behind computer science and its foundations in mathematics
\subsection{Mathematical Logic and Set Theory}
Here we discuss relevant concepts in mathematical logic and set theory
\subsection{Finite State Machines}
Here we discuss finite state machines, state diagrams, etc. to provide the necessary background to understand conceptual machines and understand Turing Machinces graphically

\section{Turing Machines}
An effective model for the general-purpose computer is the Turing Machine, developed by Alan Turing in 1936 \cite{2}.  The Turing Machine is a conceptual model of a general-purpose computing machine which involves the following conceptual components:
\begin{itemize}
	\item A "control box" which stores a finitely-large program
	\item A tape with infinite spaces in which symbols can be stored, read, and written
	\item A read-write mechanism for the tape \cite{3}
\end{itemize}
\begin{figure}[h]
	\includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{figure-3-1}
	\centering
	\caption{A simple visualization of a Turing machine.  Note that spaces along the tape would be filled with symbols which can be read and written using the read-write head on the machine.}
\end{figure}
\noindent Formally, a \textbf{Turing Machine} is defined as a 7-Tuple, $(Q, \Sigma, \Gamma, \delta, q_{0}, q_{accept}, q_{reject})$, where:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $Q$ is a finite set containing the states of the machine
	\item $\Sigma$ is a finite set containing the machine's \textbf{input alphabet}
	\item $\Gamma$ is the finite set containing th emachine's \textbf{tape alphabet} such that the \textbf{blank symbol} $\textvisiblespace \in \Gamma$ and $\Sigma \subseteq \Gamma$
	\item $\delta$ is the \textbf{transition function} $\delta: Q \times \Gamma \to Q \times \Gamma \times \{L, R\}$
	\item $q_{0}$ is the \textbf{starting state} $q_{0} \in Q$
	\item $q_{accept}$ is the \textbf{accept state} $q_{accept} \in Q$
	\item $q_{reject}$ is the \textbf{reject state} $q_{reject} \in Q$ such that $q_{reject} \neq q_{accept}$
\end{itemize}
\noindent A \textbf{configuration} represents the state of a Turing machine's read-write head along its tape, as well as the characters on the tape.  For feasibly-sized tape inputs, a configuration is given as a string of the tape's characters listed starting from the left-most character and working right, with the state $q_{n} \in Q$ inserted to the left of the character currently being read by the read-write head of the machine.  To exemplify this, we can introduce a new instance of a Turing Machine with a specific input, and an algorithm running on the input.
\begin{exmp}
Let's imagine a Turing machine running an algorithm which verifies whether or not a binary string of length n has an even weight (number of 1s in the binary string).  It might achieve this by running the following algorithm:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Read each bit from left to right on the input string and cross off every other '1' character.
	\item If in step 1 the tape contained no '1' characters, accept.
	\item If in step 1 the tape contained a single '1' character, reject.
	\item Return to the left-most character on the tape.
	\item Return to step 1.
\end{enumerate}
\noindent This particular Turing machine can be given formally as $M = (Q, \Sigma, \Gamma, \delta, q_{1}, q_{accept}, q_{reject})$ such that:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $Q \coloneq \{ q_{1}, q_{2}, q_{3}, q_{4}, q_{5}, q_{accept}, q_{reject} \}$
	\item $\Sigma \coloneq \{ 0, 1 \}$
	\item $\Gamma \coloneq \{ 0, 1, x, \textvisiblespace \}$
	\item The transition function $\delta$ is given as a state diagram (below) \cite{2}
\end{itemize}
\begin{figure}[h]
	\begin{tikzpicture}
		\node[state, initial] (q1) {$q_{1}$};
	\end{tikzpicture}
